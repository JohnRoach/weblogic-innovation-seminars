# #7605 - Hands On Tutorial #

### Introduction

Oracle Cloud is the industryâ€™s broadest and most integrated public cloud. It offers best-in-class services across software as a service (SaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and even lets you put Oracle Cloud in your own data center. Oracle Cloud helps organizations drive innovation and business transformation by increasing business agility, lowering costs, and reducing IT complexity.

#### Prepare your desktop to access the assigned cloud enviroment ###
In order to access and use the proper cloud account/environment you need to modify the following property file: `/u01/content/weblogic-innovation-seminars/cloud.demos/environment.properties`. Open the file browser and find the file to edit using `gedit`.
